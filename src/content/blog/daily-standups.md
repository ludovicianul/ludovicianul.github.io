  Daily stands-ups have a bad reputation. They are seen as a waste of time, control mechanism, or status meeting. But with the right mindset, they can be productive for anyone.

Daily Stand-Ups seem to attract a lot of hate and criticism. Reasons are quite diverse, but most commonly:
- they are too long, and seen as a waste of time
- they act as control for `management` (`management` varies with each context)
- people think they are independent and competent enough to work on their own without the `supervision` (see the above point)
- they become a status meeting i.e. you report your work, so people feel they are not independent enough (see the above point)
- you can sync in an async manner (chat, email, etc.) instead of wasting time in a (virtual) meeting

They are all valid reasons. The common denominator for all is `trust`, more precisely `the lack of trust`.
The need to justify the busy day you had yesterday and/or why you didn't do significant progress,
and how you plan to do the same today.

But this is the wrong framing. With the right mindset, daily stand-up can be productive for anyone.
