Hey! I'm Madalin. Thank you for visiting my blog.

I'm a senior software engineer at [Endava](https://endava.com). I'm passionate about security, software quality, automation and open source.
I've created a few open source [projects](https://github.com/ludovicianul), 
the most successful being [CATS](https://github.com/Endava/cats) - a tool for REST APIs fuzzing and testing.

Feel free to contact me by email at <u>iliemad</u> at <u>gmail.com</u> or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iliemadalin/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ludovicianul).
